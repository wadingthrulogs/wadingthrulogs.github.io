I hunt for evil inside networks.

My dad built our first computer by dumpster diving in the early 90s. I learned how to spell "windows" in MS-DOS. I have always had a passion for technology, computers and bending rules. Working in cyber security was always a dream of mine. I love the continuous hunt for knowledge, the thrill of falling down the rabbit hole, and most of all knowing that I'm helping a larger cause.

This blog is my attempt to give back to the security community.
