I hunt for evil inside networks.

My dad built our first computer by dumpster diving in the early 90s. I learned how to spell "windows" in MS-DOS. I have always been passionate about technology, computers, and bending the rules. Working in cyber security has always been a dream of mine. I love the continuous hunt for knowledge, the thrill of falling down the rabbit hole, and knowing I'm helping a more significant cause.

I'm currently a board member at BSides San Diego and do a lot of other work in the San Diego area.
Below are some links to videos I'm in and an article I wrote for Black Hills InfoSec
